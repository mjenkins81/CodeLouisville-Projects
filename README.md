# CodeLouisville-Projects
Dollars and Sense Financial Consulting Services is a website that introduces visitors to the website for my tax, consulting and financial literacy (soon to come). 
I used HTML based on the example from the week 5 of the Code Louisville Front End Web Development class, google (mostly W3 schools) and help from a classmate.
The project contains the following CSS features:
  Responsive Navigation menu with a hamburger icon.
  Flexbox which allows the colums to go to rows depending upon the size of the screen.
  "nth-of-type" was used to alternate the colors in mysection elements.
The project contians the followng JS feature:
  By clicking the hamburger icon when the screen has a lower resolution, the navigation bar is displayed in a vertical manner versus the horizontal manner which is static 
  when in higher resolutions.
